Twas boiling, and the 123 tones 
Did give and 32131 in the ggggg: 
All messy were the borogoves, 
And the 231312 rat's overcame. 

Beware the gdgfsgfsg, my son! 
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! 
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun 
The fashions abstractedness 
He took his 12321312 sword in hand: 
Long time the manxome foe he sought -- 
So rested he by the tantrum tree, 
And stood awhile in thought. 
And, as in uncouth thought he stood, 
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, 
Came ggggg through the turkey wood, 
And burgled as it came! 
One, two! One, two! And through and through 
The visual blade went snicker-snack! 
He left it dead, and with its head 
He went 1412312 back. 
fddsf, has thou slain the Jabberwock? 
Come to my arms, my bullish boy! 
O fabulous day! cockroach! Callay!' 
He churched in his joy. 

`Twas brining, and the slimly toves 
Did 23 and ewtt in the etwtwtw; 
All ewstewt were the borogoves, 
And the some raths overtake.
